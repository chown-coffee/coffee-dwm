# COFFEE's DWM

## <sup>[layer 1]</sup> ABOUT
This is my DWM configs, with some resources I value, mostly efficiency and performance, but also with a simplistic beauty look. I made these configs thinking in optimize both my work and daily usage the maximum as possible, with rules and shortcuts for all considerable and frequently used programs, applications, tools and even personal scripts. It took a while, but I'm really happy with the result and probably will never get used to another interface again (unless I am able to customize exactly like this one :grin:).

## <sup>layer 2</sup> INSTALLATION
Just clone this project in your machine and compile it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/dwm.git
```
```
$ cd dwm
```
```
$ sudo make clean install
```

## <sup>layer 3</sup> INFO
I'll let all the important things about the interface below, for you to get into it, however you may check the [config.h](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/dwm/blob/master/config.h) file yourself and make your own configurations (actually, you should do that). Also, I'd like to say I got some really useful resources from [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwm)'s config, which saved me a lot of time for build my own. So, a special thanks to him.

## <sup>layer 4</sup> USAGE
I use xorg as display server and xinitrc as my dwm launcher. If you want to check, there is my [~/.xinirc](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/linux-config/blob/master/.xinitrc) file. If you opt for the same method, then you just need to type `startx` in your tty, and voil√°, your DWM is launched.

So, without further ado, there are all the important things/notes about my DWM:
### <sup>layer 4.1</sup> DEPENDENCIES
Well, of course, after so many configurations, some external programs were used in a couple parts of the code, such as in keyboard shortcuts definitions, for example. So, I made a list of all the dependencies needed for my DWM works 100%. And [there it is](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/dwm/blob/master/dependencies.md).

### <sup>layer 4.2</sup> SHORTCUTS
Actually, to see all the shortcuts defined in my DWM, you may just go to my [config.h](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/dwm/blob/master/config.h) file and see the keys list. But, to make it easier (and more readable too), I created a separated file with all the shortcuts I set [right here](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/dwm/blob/master/keyboard_shortcuts.md). So, you may follow this file to get into my k.s.

### <sup>layer 4.3</sup> SCRIPTS
Actually, some of the commands I use in DWM, calls a script in my machine. So, for you to have fully access to my DWM commands, you also need those. Oh, but look at that, they are luckily also in my github, right [here](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/.scripts). Just clone that in your $HOME directory and be happy.
#### <sup>layer 4.3.1</sup> IMPORTANT
These scripts must be present in you $HOME directory, otherwise, you'll need to change the call for them inside DWM's [config.h](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/dwm/blob/master/config.h). Your choice.

### <sup>layer 4.4</sup> DWM BAR
Last but not least, my DWM bar is completely made by personal scripts. I used dwmblocks for a while, but, with the desire to put something more simplistic (my likes), I made some simple scripts to launch in it. they are also in the [.scripts](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/.scripts) directory I put previously. So, if you clone that, and put in your home directory like mentioned, you should be good. Or you can just adventure yourself in your own scripts or dwmblocks.

## <sup>[layer 5]</sup> NOTES
Well, that is pretty much it. I'd just like to put some important notes here:
* All my interface initialization is being handle by my [~/.xinirc](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/linux-config/blob/master/.xinitrc) file, so it is interesting you take a look at it, as the scripts I have for initialization are being called there. For example, my dwm status bar is launch there, so, if you do not have it, your dwm bar will not have the scripts running. Another example is the wallpaper, that is also set there. So, look the end of the file and manage which lines you do or do not want in it.

* Talking about wallpaper... Like said, my wallpaper is set by my [~/.xinirc](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/linux-config/blob/master/.xinitrc) file, and for that it automatically sets a wallpaper in path ~/wallpaper, looking for a file called wall.png or wall.jpg. So, to set a wallpaper, just create a folder called "wallpaper" in your $HOME directory and put the image you want inside it with the name "wall.png" or "wall.jpg". -"Hey Leo, but the image I want as wallpaper is neither a .png nor a .jpg file :confused:". Ok, just add an `elif` line in [~/.xinirc](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/linux-config/blob/master/.xinitrc) file, with your image extension, just like below:
```
if [ -f "$HOME/wallpaper/wall.png" ] ; then
	feh --bg-fill ~/wallpaper/wall.png &
elif [ -f "$HOME/wallpaper/wall.jpg" ] ; then
	feh --bg-fill ~/wallpaper/wall.jpg &
# added extension
elif [ -f "$HOME/wallpaper/wall.jpeg" ] ; then
	feh --bg-fill ~/wallpaper/wall.jpeg &
fi
```

* * If you want the wallpaper of prints above, it's just [here](https://github.com/fresh-cappuccino/linux-config/tree/master/wallpaper).

So, I think it's it. Thank you for the visit and have a good day.
